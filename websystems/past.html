        <h1>Primary School Life</h1>
        <h2>My Time in CSPS</h2>
        <p>From K-6 I attended Carlton South Primary School in, you guessed it, Carlton, Sydney. My Primary school life was nothing special,
            with me completing my time there with no issues. I enjoyed myself back then by playing cricket during the summer season and rugby 
            during the winter season. I also partook in the debating club which ended up winning undefeated that year under our command.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>Notable Achievements</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>Undefeated in the Year 6 Debating Season</li>
        <li>Finalist for the Number Crunchers competition for the St. George area in Year 5</li>
        <li>Rugby Player during the winter season during Year 6</li>
    </ul>
        <h1>High School & Formative Years</h1>
        <h2>High School Overview</h2>
        <p>High School was an interesting experience as I had to learn about the real world, and at the end, decide on my future career path.    
            The first years of high school were nothing special, with me keeping up with all my subjects. The fun part were the sports I took part in.
            During Year 7-11 I was part of my schools Rowing team, where I acted as the coxswain, and ended up getting to attend the Head of the River in my final year,
            which is just a large competition. In winter, I took part in Cross Country running between years 7-10 and then Rock Climbing for the last 2 years.
            <br>
            <br>
            All of those experiences shaped who I am today</p>
        <h2>Career Path</h2>
        <p>To be honest, until the very end of high school, I did not know what I wanted to be. I obviously had childish notions of becoming an astronaut when I was young,
            but in High School the first thing that interested me was History. I decided I was going to be a History Teacher. Obviously that didn't pan out coz here I am at 10pm
            writing a paragraph in html and utilising css alongside it. But moving on, in Year 11 I decided that maybe Quantum Physics was my calling, and that notion stayed with 
            me until the weeks leading up to my trials when one of my tutors convinced me to go into Software Engineering. That's what I finally landed on and have been finding it fun
            ever since.
