        <h1>High School Life</h1>
        <h2>High School Overview</h2>
        <p> In terms of computing, I had pretty much no experience by the end of high school. The most I had done in terms of development was working with a basic Python course,
            which I ended up giving up on when I couldn't figure out while loops. My chosen Career Path was a bit sudden as I'll now describe below.
        </p>
        <h2>Career Path</h2>
        <p> To be honest, until the very end of high school, I did not know what I wanted to be. I obviously had childish notions of becoming an astronaut when I was young,
            but in High School the first thing that interested me was History. I decided I was going to be a History Teacher. Obviously that didn't pan out coz here I am at 10pm
            writing a paragraph using html and css instead of using Word. But moving on, in Year 11 I decided that maybe Quantum Physics was my calling, and that notion stayed with 
            me until the weeks leading up to my trials when one of my tutors convinced me to go into Software Engineering. That's what I finally landed on and have been finding it 
            fulfilling ever since.

        <h1>University Life</h1>
        <h2>University Overview</h2>
        <p> Coming into University with no prior knowledge of coding or computing practices was quite hard. For the first semester, I learnt Java, which was my gateway into the
            other languages I know now such as C++, JavaScript and TypeScript. Now I find that computing and coding is much easier and am not too fussed about not having any 
            experience upon entry.
