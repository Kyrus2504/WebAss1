            This is a story about my life. Where should we start? AH, I know!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state
            <br>
            Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started, wait
            <br>
            The earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool
            <br>
            Neanderthals developed tools
            <br>
            We built a wall (we built the pyramids)
            <br>
            Math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries
            <br>
            That all started with the big bang (bang)
            <br>
            Since the dawn of man is really not that long
            <br>
            As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song
            <br>
            A fraction of a second and the elements were made
            <br>
            The bipeds stood up straight, the dinosaurs all met their fate
            <br>
            They tried to leap but they were late
            <br>
            And they all died (they froze their asses off)
            <br>
            The oceans and Pangea, see ya wouldn't wanna be ya
            <br>
            Set in motion by the same big bang
            <br>
            It all started with the big bang
            <br>
            It's expanding ever outward but one day
            <br>
            It will pause and start to go the other way
            <br>
            Collapsing ever inward, we won't be here, it won't be heard
            <br>
            Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang
            <br>
            Australopithecus would really have been sick of us
            <br>
            Debating how we're here, they're catching deer (we're catching viruses)
            <br>
            Religion or astronomy (Descartes or Deuteronomy)
            <br>
            It all started with the big bang
            <br>
            Music and mythology, Einstein and astrology
            <br>
            It all started with the big bang
            <br>
            It all started with the big bang
